# Simple-Client-Server-Program

For this project, a client-server program was to be written in such a way that the Client creates and sends (to the server) an array of 1,000 randomly generated integers, and once the Server program has the array, the Server has to sort it using merge sort, and then send it back to the Client. An appropriate user interface was also needed so as to allow the Client to enter the IP address of the Server, and then connect to said Server, whether or not it was on the same machine. Merge Sort, done via parallel processing was also an objective for the program. Refer to clientserverss.png for a screenshot of the program in action.
